Project template based on webpack5 + vue2X + ts

<details>
<summary>CLICK ME</summary>

<summary>You don’t need to look at any documents. After clone, it means the project exists. Of course, if you have some special configuration (for example: eslint), you still have to check the eslint documentation (if you are not familiar with it). Scaffolding is useless to help the project generate production. Environment configuration and some commonly used configurations (cross-domain configuration), any part needs to check the data integration (using GitHub action for CI/CD, etc.. So what you see is what you get.
</details>

Solve project configuration problems. Compared with vite or some other scaffolding tools, this solves the problems of production environment configuration, cross-domain interface request, CI/CD configuration, etc. (Of course, the premise is that your project needs to be like me [configure production environment](./docs/use-en.md) related), which allows you to concentrate more on completing the project's page development. When the development is completed, you can quickly deploy, so that everyone can see the results, instead of only running on your local service Down.

Sometimes it will reject some highly integrated tools, and sometimes it will make people find it difficult to start.
